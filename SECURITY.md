# Security Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the security enhancements implemented in the project.

## 1. Security Headers

Security headers have been implemented in two ways:
- Through `next.config.js` (basic implementation)
- Via middleware.ts (more flexible, path-specific control)

Headers implemented include:
- **X-DNS-Prefetch-Control**: Controls DNS prefetching
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Provides XSS protection for older browsers
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME-sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features
- **Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only**: Starts CSP in report mode to avoid breaking the site
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS (production only)

## 2. CORS Protection

- Removed wildcard CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) from `/studio/:path*` routes
- Implemented origin-checking logic in middleware for studio routes
- Added allowlist of trusted origins based on environment

## 3. API Security

- Added rate limiting for form submission and appointment endpoints
- Enhanced input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Added proper error handling and sanitized error responses

## 4. Dependency Security

- Updated Next.js from canary version to stable version (14.1.3)
- Set up Dependabot for automated vulnerability scanning
- Ran `npm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities

## 5. Next Steps

The following additional security improvements are recommended:

1. **Complete Vulnerability Fixes**: Run `npm audit fix --force` if you're comfortable with potential breaking changes to dependencies
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all sensitive credentials are stored as environment variables in Netlify (not in code)
3. **CSP Fine-tuning**: After deployment, monitor CSP reports and transition from report-only to enforced mode
4. **Authentication**: For admin areas, implement proper authentication mechanisms
5. **Secret Scanning**: Set up automated scanning for accidental secret commits
6. **Regular Audits**: Schedule regular security reviews and dependency updates

## 6. Production Deployment

When deploying to production:
1. Set all required environment variables in Netlify
2. Ensure CORS is correctly configured for your production domain
3. Verify all security headers are active using tools like [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com)
4. Consider adding additional protections like Cloudflare or Netlify's built-in security features
